To compute traditional metrics:
 
- pip install torchmetrics 

To compute BLEURT-20:

- pip install git+https://github.com/lucadiliello/bleurt-pytorch.git

To compute COMET-MQM_2021 or COMET-QE-MQM_2021:

- pip install --upgrade pip  # ensures that pip is current 
- pip install unbabel-comet

If loading the model directly from Hugging Face does not work, you may need to download it locally: 
- Use the link: https://unbabel.github.io/COMET/html/models.html#available-evaluation-models
- download wmt21-comet-mqm (for COMET-MQM_2021) and wmt21-comet-qe-mqm (for COMET-QE-MQM_2021)
